			<p>Since I've created my own open-air job hunt, I figured it only makes sense to share a little background. I designed this webpage after an out-of-state move and an eight-month search that has tested both my patience and my car's mileage. These days, my commute is 5 hours round-trip—which is kind of making me feel like I'm paying to be there. So, if you know someone who knows someone—I'm your gal, and I'm looking for a new opportunity here in Central Maryland.</p>

			<p>As for my professional experience, I am currently the Office and Warehouse Manager at a Safety/Janitorial Distribution company. Not to spend too much time reiterating previous pages, but my duties are not limited to procurement, shipping logistics, or my unexpected forklift skills. I have worked in retail, and in commercial cleaning and I bring everything I've learned to the table.</p>

			<p>Most recently, my team was recognized for preventing a very costly freight charge. A 24-pallet delivery needed rerouting, and instead of tackling it solo, I divided the work strategically. I took on the billing departments while I assigned others to contact the shipper, trucking company, and customer. Our quick coordination stalled the delivery long enough for us to get it redirected—and off of our books. It was a true team effort, and it enforced what I believe: great teams don't just "follow," they collaborate. Although, a good solo project is always something to look forward to.</p>

			<p>That said, I'm also open to opportunities beyond my current industry. I've long been drawn to fields in healthcare like working with differently abled or aging adults or skilled trade industries like elevator mechanics, and welding. I'm rather open-minded and always excited to learn!</p>

			<p>While my approach to job hunting may be unconventional, I believe it reflects my determination, and resourcefulness. And at the very least, I know I stood out.<br><br>If you see a role I might be a good fit for, please reach out through my home page. And thanks for stopping by.</p>
